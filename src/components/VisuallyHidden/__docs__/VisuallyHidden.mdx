{/* <Meta of={Button} title="Button" /> */}

# Button

Visually Hidden is used when an element needs to be available to assistive technologies like screen readers, but be otherwise hidden. Use this component to provide context to information that may only be visually communicated.

#### Example

{/* <Canvas of={Button.Primary} /> */}

## Usage

```ts
import {Button} from "sld-ui";

const Example = () => {
  return (
      <Button
        size={"small"}
        text={"Button"}
        onClick={()=> console.log("Clicked")}
        primary
      />
  );
};

export default Example;
```

#### Arguments

- **text** _`() => void`_ - A string that represents the text content of the button.
- **primary** - A boolean indicating whether the button should have a primary styling or not. Typically, a primary button stands out as the main action in a user interface.
- **disabled** - A boolean indicating whether the button should be disabled or not. When disabled, the button cannot be clicked or interacted with.
- **size** - A string with one of three possible values: "small," "medium," or "large." It defines the size or dimensions of the button.
- **onClick** - A function that is called when the button is clicked. It receives a MouseEventHandler for handling the click event on the button element.
